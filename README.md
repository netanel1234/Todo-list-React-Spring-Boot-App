# Todo-list-React-Spring-Boot-App

I wrote this project during my undergraduate studies in computer science. So we wrote the project using 
#Vanilla Java#, #JavaServlets# and #JSP# and the client side was implemented with #HTML#.

I decided to improve it and implemented the project this time with #Spring Boot# on the server side and #React# on the client side. I also added #Authentication# using #JWT# and the passwords are stored encrypted in the database.
